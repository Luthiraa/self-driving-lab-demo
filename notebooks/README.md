# Notebook Tutorials and Demonstrations

This is a collection of tutorial notebooks and demonstrations for the
self-driving-lab-demo! First, you should get started with the main, public-facing tutorial. Just click
the following "Open in Colab" badge: [![Open In
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/blob/main/notebooks/4.2-paho-mqtt-colab-sdl-demo-test.ipynb)

<!-- Next comes the use of the PicoW-SDL-Demo via hosting a local web server (`Pico W / MicroPython implementation`) and
then using Internet-of-things-style communication to remotely control the PicoW
(`Controlling the Pico W Remotely (IoT-style)`). There is also a notebook on controlling
the Pico using a nonwireless option (i.e. compatible when WiFi is not available /
difficult to connect to or when nonwireless Pico is being used). -->

## All Tutorials

```{note}
Tutorials from sections 1, 2, and 3 are deprecated due to changes in hardware and
software design of
the demo (i.e., dropping "Blinkt!" in favor of built-in RGB LED on Maker Pi Pico base,
and dropping a web server interface in favor of MQTT).
Since they are instructive and show parts of the behind-the-scenes development process, they are kept here for reference and provenance.
